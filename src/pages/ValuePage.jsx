          <h3 className="uppercase font-bold text-xl">evangelism</h3>
          <p>
            It is the presentation of Jesus Christ in the power of the Holy
            Spirit with the view that people will come and trust Jesus as
            Saviour and Lord and serve him in the fellowship of the Church.
            Evangelism is the responsibility of every Church member. It is the
            prime duty of every believer to share his/her faith after
            conversion. The scope of evangelism was initially Ghana, extending
            to Africa and to the whole world. Evangelism is missions-oriented;
            farmers, women, artisans, fishermen, intellectuals, etc. go out into
            other countries, preach Christ, open churches and call in ministers
            to pastor same. Besides, as was the practice of the founder, Pastor
            James McKeown, we respond to calls to missions as led by the Spirit
            of the Lord.

          <h3 className="uppercase font-bold text-xl">discipleship</h3>
          <p>
            Discipleship is training believers to be like Christ. The emphasis
            is on holiness, righteousness, faithfulness, honesty, sincerity,
            humility, prayerfulness and the leading of disciplined and
            responsible lives. This is done at the level of individuals, where
            every member takes responsibility to discipline their new coverts,
            as well as through church/corporate based systematic teaching, and
            on-the-job training. Teaching emphasizes the four-square gospel,
            which is Christ-centered: i.e. Jesus the Saviour, Healer, Baptizer
            and Soon Coming King; the Tenets of the Church; Bible reading/study
            and scripture memorization and application of the word to life
            situations.

          <p>
            We seek to honour God who gave His best (the Saviour) by maintaining
            a high standard of excellence in all our ministries and activities
            (Col. 3:23-24)

          <h3 className="uppercase font-bold text-xl">core practices</h3>
          <p>
            Some of the normal practices are regular prayer for the Holy Spirit
            baptism with initial evidence of speaking in tongues. Emphasis is
            placed on the fruit and gifts of the Spirit in the life of the
            believer. Prayers are said for healing and deliverance for the
            afflicted as part of the initial exercises for salvation. Services
            are marked as truly Pentecostal with praise and worship, teaching,
            exercise of gifts, prayer, testimony, etc.

          <h3 className="uppercase font-bold text-xl">the holy spirit</h3>
          <p>
            We believe in the presence of the person of the Holy Spirit and that
            the Christian life can be led only with His grace. The new birth is
            the work of the Holy Spirit, and then the baptism of the Holy Spirit
            for power to serve and the gifts of the Spirit for building the body
            of Christ. The Holy Spirit helps the individual to develop a
            Christ-like character, manifest through bearing the fruit of the
            Spirit. The leading of the Holy Spirit in all spheres of activity in
            the Church is paramount. Administrative structures and all other
            church distinctiveness have been by the leading of the Holy Spirit.
            The Church, through her leadership at all levels, co-operates in
            obedience.

          <h3 className="uppercase font-bold text-xl">leadership</h3>
          <p>
            Leadership development is based on the apostolic foundation.
            Appointments and callings into leadership positions are based on
            character and charisma, and the leading of the Holy Spirit.
            Leadership development is from the shop floor, grass root level with
            members maturing to lead sub-groups, movements, assemblies,
            districts and areas. Team spirit with talent development shapes team
            work. Ministry is by both clergy and laity.
