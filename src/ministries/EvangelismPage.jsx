          gospel rallies, crusades, conventions, house to-house evangelism, and
          other forms of evangelism, etc. <br /> These include preaching,
          witnessing, winning and disciplining souls, and encouraging church

          and to further expose them to the various ministries within the
          Church. It affords members of the Church the opportunity to plan and
          organise programmes and activities for evangelism in villages, towns
          and cities and other specialised evangelism-related ministries. <br />
          It also carries out counselling sessions and ministers to prisoners
          and Rastafarians, emerging religious groups, the physically
          challenged, drug addicts, politicians and in hospitals; organises
          beach events and any other specialised areas of evangelism.
